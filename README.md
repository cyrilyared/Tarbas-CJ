# Tarbas CodeJam Repository

Our society is governed by lines (or queues as they call it on the other side of the pond). We see lines everywhere from checkout lines to security lines at airports to lines to visit tourist attractions to lines of cars waiting during a traffic jam. When it comes to lines, the most important question always seems to be, "when will I get out of this line." The goal of Tarbas is to find this answer.
